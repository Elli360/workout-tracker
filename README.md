# Workout-tracker
This assignment requested that we create a workout tracker. We were provided with the front end code in the Develop folder. The steps were to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
  
## User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Technologies Used:
* Express
* Mongo
